# Charrys Dev - Full-Stack Development Student
Hello everyone! My name is **David Santiago Charrys Pacheco**, I live in Barranquilla, Colombia and I'm a programming student. I'm studying to be a Full-Stack developer. So far, I've learned HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Git, and now I'm learning TypeScript, React and Python.

## Where do I study?
I am taking an IBM Professional Certificate on Coursera. It consists of a series of 12 courses that you must complete, in which they teach the things we need to learn to be Full-Stack Developers, such as Cloud Computing, Git & GitHub, HTML, CSS, & JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, Django, Flask, databases and containers. I also watch some classes and courses on YouTube.
